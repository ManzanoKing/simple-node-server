I have to older siblings, who are my playmates and my toughest enemies. I guess I could say my childhood is very fun, I grew up going often to church, and my church, Church Among the Palms, happens to have a school, Christian School International, as a ministry where I have been attending for 12 years before I went to college. Basically, it was fun for I was and is still being encouraged to try out things that would benefit me.

I've had a lot of friends for the majority of our batch has been in the school more than half our lifes, and mainly the kids from church. High school just has that high atmosphere, smooth sailing, a little bumbs on the middle but still we're a ble to overcome. It was a very sureal experience, our batch seems to be very united that is why. We have each other's back, we are a "Support Group" through seriuos and crazy desicions -- we were able to get rid of the rowdy and annoying ones (team work). As a matter of fact, when we were in our senior year our batch is the first to ever conduct an official fieldtrip through student initiatives. To sum it up, high school is just a party, fun yet short lived, but still is very much memorable.

It's just until now, in college, that I have had a failing grade, nonetheless, it doesn't seem to bother me much, like "my hands are in the air like I just don't care." Still, I was moving forward towards my goal. Also, majority of my friends from school and church study in the university, making it much easier to cope with the pressure and stress I am experiencing. Over all, college, as for the moment, is manageable. The key to survive it is to clearly know your goal and have a good support system.

I want to be someone who's passionately knowledgeable of the process of social, political, and economic development, so as to be able to give right advices and make right decisions. Mainly, I want to be a help to those who wants change for the betterment and benefit of all.
