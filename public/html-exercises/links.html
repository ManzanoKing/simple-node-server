		<em>Top 3 movie picks</em>
		<br>
				<p>
				 <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2397535/">Predestination</a>falls under the third spot of my top 3 movies. It is just amazing how the story of 3 different characters were stitched to one, cohesively. Also, I can say that the story and the plot of the movie was very much taken thought of. To be able to produce such bizzare story through a film is just outstanding.
				</p>
			
				<p>
					Second, is the animated movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0396555/">Meet the Robinsons</a>. The first time I have seen it in Disney channel when I was a kid, I was just instantly hooked up to it. I love how it focused on family, and especially on hoping for a brighter tomorrow and just "keep moving forward."
				</p>

				<p>
					And the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/list/ls000671664/">Harry Potter series</a> falls on the top spot! I just love the idea of being a wizard, going to Hogwarts, embarking on an adventure with friends, and battling against a multitude of villains overnight, risking your life.

		<em>Top 3 songs</em>
		<br>

				<p>
					Third on the list is, <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfJRX-8SXOs">"Feeling Good"</a> by Nina Simone. I like this because it sounds really old, well it's a really old song. It just have that hope in it, like there's a new chance to make everything right or better.
				</p>

				<p>
					On the second spot, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kVVn80pFOc">"Parting Glass"</a> specifically the cover of Ed Sheeran. I just love how haunting it sounds, and how great it is to be an ending song for a gig. 
				</p>

				<p>
					<a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4BLVznuWnU">"Lego House"</a> tops the list! It is because it's the first song by Ed Sheeran that I have fell in love with. Basically, being an avid Harry Potter fan, back in 2011, I accidentally was hooked to it because of Rupert Grint, assuming that he has changed his name and started a singing career. I then came to know the truth and since then I have been a fan of Ed Sheeran.
